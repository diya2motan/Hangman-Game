				if(array of letters ){

				}
				if (the the pressed letter is included in the array & not included in the letters already guessed){
					get the index of this letter in the array
					display it in the right position on the dashes
					increment wins by 1
					decrement number of guesses remaining by 1	
					display it on the letters already guessed
					break the loop
				}
				else{
					decrement number of guesses by 1
